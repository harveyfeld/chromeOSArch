<h2>chromeOSArch</h2>
This interactive bash script will install Arch Linux ARM onto your SD card or USB drive from ChromeOS. This will allow you to boot directly onto the SD card and avoid ChromeOS or ChrUbuntu all together.

<h4>Installation guide for XE303C12</h4>
We need access to root for this script to work, we can get access by enabling developer mode.

The latest image of Arch Linux ARM seems to have broken drivers for wifi. Replace wget link on line 34 with http://rollback.archlinuxarm.org/os/{year}/{month}/{day}/ArchLinuxARM-chromebook-latest.tar.gz for older working versions of Arch.
